Of course, it goes without saying that this dataset contains spoilers ;)

This dataset combines three sources of data, all of which are based on information from the book series.

*Firstly, there is battles.csv which contains Chris Albon's "The War of the Five Kings" Dataset. Its a great collection of all of the battles in the series.

*Secondly we have character-deaths.csv from Erin Pierce and Ben Kahle. This dataset was created as a part of their Bayesian Survival Analysis.

*Finally we have a more comprehensive character dataset with character-predictions.csv. It includes their predictions on which character will die.

It also includes their predictions on which character will die, the methodology of which can be found here: https://got.show/machine-learning-algorithm-predicts-death-game-of-thrones
